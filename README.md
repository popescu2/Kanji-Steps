# Kanji-Steps
Copyright (c) 2015 Matthew Popescu

KanjiSteps is an Android application that will help users memorize Kanji definitions and readings. This app is intended to complement a college course as an extra tool for students to use.

The app will let users go through a "learning" process, where they will learn the meaning and reading of each Kanji.
The app will quiz the users for each learned Kanji on a spaced interval.
Future features include stroke order animations, syncronized vocabulary lists, and grammar quizzes.
