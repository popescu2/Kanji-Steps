The data structure used to hold all of the data (kanji lists, readings, etc) is stored in a database locally. (on the user's phone)

The database is structured as follows.

Columns:
-Kanji symbol *String
-English meaning *String
-Chinese Reading (onyomi) *String
-Japanese Reading (kunyomi) *String
-Level *String
-Progress *float
-Next Review Time *long


My project has a "spaced repetition" system in place. What that means is if you successfully answer a question, you won't be asked that question again until a later time. If you answer it right again, the time until the next review will increase until it reaches even years in length.

To begin, if you answer a question correctly, it will prompt you again in one hour.
If you answer it correctly again, it will prompt you again in 2 hours.
Then 4, then 8, then 16, then 32, then 64, etc. When you reach progress 13, you cannot go higher. At this point, it will quiz you again in about a year. so I won't make it higher than that.
